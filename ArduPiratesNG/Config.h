   2. CHOOSE YOUR FLIGHT MODE:
= ============================================================================ =

   The next step is to choose your FLIGHT MODE.
   This is done by setting switch 3 of the DIP switch on your APM to on or of.
   After switching to another flight mode you will need to reboot your APM by
   disconnecting and reconnecting power.

   Acrobatic mode; your multicopter will be handling as a traditional RC
   helicopter. You will have to constantly correct it's flight path to keep it
   up in the air - like balancing on a ball. On the other hand, this is the mode
   that will allow some aerobatics.

   Stable mode; your multicopter will be automatically piloted by the APM and in
   an ideal configuration you'll only have to command it with your transmitter
   when you want it to change it's position in the air. Stability, horizontal
   attitude, altitude etc. will be controller by the autopilot functionality.

   http://code.google.com/p/arducopter/wiki/Quad_Magnetos

   under additional settings. Both values have to be incorporated.

   You can check Declination to your location from

   Example:  Magnetic north calibration show -1.2 degrees offset and declination
   (true north) is -5.6 then the MAGCALIBRATION should be -6.8. Your GPS
   readings are based on true north.
   For Magnetic north calibration make sure that your Magnetometer is truly
   showing 0 degress when your ArduQuad is looking to the North. Use a real
   compass (not your iPhone !) to point your ArduQuad to the magnetic north and
   then adjust this value until you have a 0 degrees reading in the

   Functions for: Camera mounted to the multicopter

   You can build or buy a special mount for your photo camera which is attached
   to your multicopter. Using one or more servos you can have the multicopter
   automatically tilt and roll the camera so it stays horizontal, regardless of
   the multicopter's position in the air (also called attitude).

   In order for camera stabilization to work you will have to change the
   settings in the section below (called 'Camera related settings') to match
   your needs and hardware.

   If you want to enable camera stabilization, uncomment the IsCAM line and set
   the DIP2 switch on your APM to ON (down). If you wish to disable camera
   stabilization, comment the IsCAM line by placing a double slash (//) at the
   beginning of the line, but also set DIP2 on your APM to OFF (up) !

   IMPORTANT: To finalize the configuration of camera stabilization you will
   need to use the Configurator and send the K command. Refer to the Wiki for
   more info on the Configurator and this specific command.
                                                                              */

   Function for: Battery voltage monitoring
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -

   The APM is capable of monitoring the voltage level of your LiPo battery
   across each individual cell. If you have soldered the voltage dividers and
   wish to monitor the power level of your battery, uncomment the next line by
   removing the double slash (//) at the beginning of the line. Refer to the
   ArduCopter Wiki for more information on this subject:
   http://code.google.com/p/ardupirates/wiki/BatteryAlarmHowto
                                                                              */

   This section helps you setup the safety features of your multicopter.
   Defaults are generally okay. We advise you to read through them, but not to
   change anything unless you are very sure about what you are doing.
                                                                              */

   6. MISCELLANIOUS SETTINGS

   This section is for advanced or experienced users only. If you are just
   starting out with your multicopter you probably do not need to change
   anything here. You can leave all settings below at their default values.

   Serial communication and wireless link
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -

   Serial data, do we have FTDI cable or Xbee on Telemetry port as our primary
   command link. If we are using normal FTDI/USB port as our telemetry/
   configuration, keep next line disabled.
                                                                              */

   PID tuning with your transmitter (radio)
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -

   To enable PID tuning, uncomment the below line.
   !You also have to uncomment #define SerXbee otherwise it will not work!
   PID tuning uses your 3 position switch on your radio, the same you use to
   select the flightmode. You will need a radio with at least 7 channels.
   Your Aux1 will be your 3 position channel, and your radio has to be in acro
   (plane) mode.
                                                                              */
